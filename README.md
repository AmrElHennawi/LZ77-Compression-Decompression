# LZ77 Compression Algorithm Implementation

Welcome to our LZ77 compression algorithm implementation project.

**Project Overview:**
This repository contains a Java implementation of the LZ77 compression algorithm. The LZ77 algorithm is a lossless data compression algorithm that replaces repeated occurrences of data with references to a single copy. It is widely used in various compression utilities and applications.

**Program Structure:**
Our project is organized into a single Java class, `LZ77Compression`. This class contains methods to compress and decompress data using the LZ77 algorithm.
`Tag` This class is a data structure to store and manipulate LZ77 compression information.

**Features:**
- Compresses text data using the LZ77 algorithm.
- Decompresses LZ77-compressed data to recover the original text.
